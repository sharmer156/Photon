### Photon 是一款轻量级的快速爬虫框架，你可以使用它提取网址、电子邮件、文件、网站账户信息等。它有如下几大优点：



数据提取：能够抓取广泛的数据格式，包括 URLs/parameter URLs，电子邮件，社交媒体账号，文件 （pdf、png、xml 等），密匙（API keys、hashes 等），JS 文件，正则化字符串等。

多线程爬取：能够智能化地多线程爬取所需信息

Ninja Mode：将有 3 个在线服务为你发送目标请求，最大限度提高链接速度，并降低连接重置的风险及单客户端的延迟请求。

Plugins：具有 dnsdumpster 和 Exporter 可用接口，Quark 和 XSStrike 接口也在积极开发中。

无缝更新：维护团队将持续、频繁地更新该项目，并保持版本无缝衔接。

Photon is a lightning fast web crawler which extracts URLs, files, intel & endpoints from a target.

160 requests per second while extensive data extraction is just another day for Photon!

### Documentation
- [Using Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage)
- [Compatibility & Dependencies](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Compatibility-&-Dependencies)

> Photon is now also available as a [library](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Photon-Library).

## Main Features

The extensive range of [options](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage) provided by Photon lets you crawl the web exactly the way you want, which is a cool thing on its own.
However, the features of Photon that make it awesome are follows:

#### Data Extraction
Photon extracts the following data while crawling by default:

- URLs (in-scope & out-of-scope)
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- Secret keys (auth/API keys & hashes)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings based on custom regex pattern

The extracted information is saved in an organized manner.\

#### Intelligent Multithreading
Here's a secret, most of the tools floating on the internet aren't properly multi-threaded even if they are supposed to. They either supply a list of items to threads which results in multiple threads accessing the same item or they simply put a thread lock and end up rendering multi-threading useless.\
But Photon is different or should I say "genius"? Take a look at [this](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/blob/8b58580df1bdfe5f7b96eaf83957d018418ec8ae/photon.py#L357-L381) and decide yourself.

#### Ninja Mode
In Ninja Mode, 3 online services are used to make requests to the target on your behalf.\
So basically, now you have 4 clients making requests to the same server simultaneously which gives you a speed boost if you have a slow connection, minimizes the risk of connection reset as well as delays requests from a single client.\
Here's a comparison generated by [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark) where the lines represent threads:

#### Plugins
Photon's capabilites can be further extended by using plugins.

Available plugins:

- **[dnsdumpster](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#dumping-dns-data)**: Generates an image containing the DNS data of the target domain.
- **[Exporter](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#export-formatted-result)**: Plugin to export results in JSON, support for more formats is being worked on.

Plugins in active development:

- **Quark**: A plugin to plot a graph making it easier to inspect relationships between different webpages using [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark).
- **XSStrike**: Modular & *targeted* version of [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike) to be used with Photon.
- **dnsdumpster**: A new version of the plugin is in development which will save the DNS data in a nicely formatted HTML file.

#### Frequent & Seemless Updates
The project is under heavy development and updates for fixing bugs. optimizing performance & new features are being rolled everyday.

If you would like to see features and issues that are being worked on, you can do that on [Development]() project board.

Updates can be installed & checked for with the `--update` option. Photon has seamless update capabilities which means you can update Photon without losing any of your saved data.
